    "Thus far we have looked at regression and investigating how we can predict a continuous variable. Another category of problems in data science is to classify class membership. For example, we might want to predict whether or not someone has cancer, whether a video is appropriate for children, or what species an animal is. These problems are fundamentally different in their formulation because of the desired outputs.\n",

    "The simplest case of this is a binary classification of 0 or 1. Typically 0 stands for 'not a member' while 1 stands for 'is a member'.  \n",

    "Here's some of the most important classification algorithms which we'll investigate in further depth in coming lessons:  \n",

    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "    * Calculates the probability of class membership using the sigmoid function. Then assigns class membmership.\n",
    "* Decision Trees\n",
    "    * Split the dataset feature by feature according to which feature will improve the accuracy of classification. For example, those with cholosterol higher than a certain value (to be specified using the tree algorithm) have risk for heart disease, those below that value don't incur a risk. Next, you can go onto another feature in the data set, such as age. \n",
    "* Random Forests\n",
    "    * An ensemble method for combining multiple decision trees.\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines\n",
    "    * Draws a decision plane seperating the classes. Maximizes the distance between datapoints and this plane."
